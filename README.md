A functional approach to the three js tutorial at https://www.august.com.au/blog/animating-scenes-with-webgl-three-js/

Three js is heavily dependant on classes, side effects, setters and getters. The use of composition made sense to me as it alleviates the style with a more declarative and composable form while coping with intrinsic mutations of their instances.


`js/original` is the code used at https://www.august.com.au/blog/animating-scenes-with-webgl-three-js/

`js/pivot` is an excercise I found at https://jsfiddle.net/0y7mLwfh/

Neither of them are used directly in the example

Getting started

Usual suspects

`npm install`

`npm start`
